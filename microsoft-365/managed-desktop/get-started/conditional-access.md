# Adjust settings after enrollment

After you've completed enrollment in Microsoft Managed Desktop, you need to adjust certain Microsoft Intune and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) settings to allow for management and maintain security. Set the following settings to exclude the Azure AD groups that contain Microsoft Managed Desktop devices and users. For steps to exclude groups, see [Conditional Access: Users and groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-users-groups#exclude-users).

Note that policy changes made by tenant admins in Intune, Azure AD and M365 policies after Microsoft Management Desktop enrollment may prevent Microsoft Managed Desktop from operating properly. Prior to making a policy change, review the conditions related to specific setting listed in [Fix issues found by the readiness assessment tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/managed-desktop/get-ready/readiness-assessment-fix?view=o365-worldwide) to ensure the change will not cause errors in Microsoft Management Desktop operations.

## Microsoft Intune settings

- Autopilot deployment profile: exclude the **Modern Workplace Devices -All**  Azure AD group. For steps, see [Enroll Windows devices in Intune by using Windows Autopilot](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/autopilot/enrollment-autopilot).
- Conditional Access policies: exclude the **Modern Workplace Service Accounts** Azure AD group. For steps, see [Conditional Access: Users and groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-users-groups).
- Multifactor authentication: make sure any conditional access policies that require multifactor authentication exclude the **Modern Workplace Service Accounts** Azure AD group. For more information, see [Conditional access policies](../get-ready/readiness-assessment-fix.md#conditional-access-policies) and [Conditional Access: Require MFA for all users](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-all-users-mfa).
- Security baseline: exclude the **Modern Workplace Devices -All**  Azure AD group. For steps, see [Use security baselines to configure Windows 10 devices in Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/protect/security-baselines).
- Windows 10 update ring: exclude the **Modern Workplace Devices -All**  Azure AD group. For steps, see [Manage Windows 10 software updates in Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/protect/windows-update-for-business-configure).


## Azure Active Directory settings

Self-service password reset: choose **Selected** setting, and then select **Modern Workplace Devices -All** Azure AD group. For more information, see [Tutorial: Enable users to unlock their account or reset passwords using Azure Active Directory self-service password reset](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-sspr).
