# Fix issues found by the readiness assessment tool

For each check, the tool will report one of three possible results:


|Result  |Meaning  |
|---------|---------|
|Ready     | No action is required before completing enrollment.        |
|Advisory    | Follow the steps in the tool or this article for the best experience with enrollment and for users. You *can* complete enrollment, but you must fix these issues before you deploy your first device.        |
|Not ready | *Enrollment will fail if you don't fix these issues.* Follow the steps in the tool or this article to resolve them.        |

## Microsoft Intune settings

### Autopilot deployment profile

You shouldn't have any existing Autopilot profiles that target assigned or dynamic groups used by Microsoft Managed Desktop. Microsoft Managed Desktop uses Autopilot to provision new devices.

**Not ready**

You have an Autopilot profile that is assigned to all devices. For steps, see 
[Enroll Windows devices in Intune by using Windows Autopilot](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/autopilot/enrollment-autopilot). After Microsoft Managed Desktop enrollment, set your Autopilot policy to exclude the **Modern Workplace Devices -All** Azure AD group.

**Advisory**

Make sure that your Autopilot profiles target an assigned or dynamic Azure AD group that doesn't include Microsoft Managed Desktop devices that will be created at enrollment. For steps, see 
[Enroll Windows devices in Intune by using Windows Autopilot](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/autopilot/enrollment-autopilot). After Microsoft Managed Desktop enrollment, set your Autopilot policy to exclude the **Modern Workplace Devices -All** Azure AD group.


### Certificate connectors

If you have any certificate connectors used by the devices you want to enroll in Microsoft Managed Desktop, the connectors cannot have any errors. Only one of the following advisories will apply to your situation, so check them carefully.

**Advisory**

No certificate connectors are present. It's possible you don't need any connectors, but you should evaluate whether you might need some for network connectivity to Microsoft Managed Desktop devices. For more information, see [Prepare certificates and network profiles for Microsoft Managed Desktop](certs-wifi-lan.md).

**Advisory**

At least one certificate connector has an error. If you need this connector for connectivity to Microsoft Managed Desktop devices, you must resolve the error. For more information, see [Prepare certificates and network profiles for Microsoft Managed Desktop](certs-wifi-lan.md).
